# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Haskell.

To run the solutions for a day, pipe the input into stdin like this:

```
$ stack runghc src/Day01.hs < inputs/day01.txt
```

Day 12 part 2 relies on an external quadratic fit, Day 24 Part 2 relies on Z3,
and Day 25 relies on GraphViz.
